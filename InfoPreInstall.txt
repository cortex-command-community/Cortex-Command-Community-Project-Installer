Thank you for downloading the Cortex Command Community Project, we hope you enjoy the changes and improvements the community has made.

If you'd like to contribute, report bugs, follow development more closely, or just chat about the game, please join us in Discord - https://discord.gg/TSU6StNQUG
We've got great plans for the future, and we're always looking for more contributors to help bring Cortex Command to new heights!

Our website also has a bunch of useful links - https://cortex-command-community.github.io

One final, important note - mods from older versions of the game will NOT work with this version. However, there's a Mod Converter packaged with the game that should be able to convert most mods, and we've got a lot of great new and converted mods on our mod portal - https://cccp.mod.io
